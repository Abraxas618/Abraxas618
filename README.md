## Executive Overview

This repository provides a consolidated archive of Baramay Station Research Inc.’s ongoing exploratory research programs. All work presented here is strictly experimental, under active research and development, and has not undergone formal verification, certification, peer review, or independent validation of any scientific or engineering claims.

The artefacts in this archive represent pre-deployment research prototypes, mathematical investigations, and conceptual system architectures. They must not be interpreted as production technologies, operational capabilities, or confirmed cryptographic assurances.

## Research Focus

Baramay Station Research Inc. conducts applied research at the intersection of:

- post-quantum cryptography
- verifiable computation
- high-dimensional mathematical modeling
- mesh network infrastructure
- simulation-aligned extended-reality architectures

The organization operates as a non-profit technical laboratory dedicated to transparent, reproducible, open-source scientific inquiry.

## Primary R&D Programs

All programs listed are exploratory prototypes subject to ongoing analysis and refinement.

### TetraCodex
Recursive post-quantum cryptographic model and entropy-structured codex architecture.

### TetraKlein
Multidimensional verifiable computation framework and XR-integrated runtime environment.

### TetraUnified
