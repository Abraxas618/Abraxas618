### Summary
*TetraKlein* defines a unified computational substrate designed for mid–21st-century digital infrastructure —  
a mathematically verifiable system that integrates post-quantum security, recursive proof verification, and XR-based global-state synchronization.

> “Can we design a provably trustworthy computational substrate — one that unifies post-quantum, zero-knowledge, and XR physics into a single verifiable framework?”

## Research Focus

The laboratory investigates early-stage concepts across several domains:

- post-quantum cryptography  
- experimental VM and execution models  
- distributed and mesh networking concepts  
- verifiable computation  
- navigation and inertial-drift modeling  
- simulation-aligned system design  

All projects are exploratory and evolve as research progresses.
