## Executive Overview

Baramay Station Research Inc. is an independent Canadian nonprofit laboratory conducting exploratory research into advanced computation, cryptography, and distributed systems.

This GitHub hosts concept prototypes, theoretical investigations, and research-in-progress artifacts. All material is:

- non-functional  
- experimental  
- unverified  
- intended for academic and exploratory purposes only  

None of the repositories represent production systems, validated cryptography, or operational technologies.

## Research Focus

The laboratory investigates early-stage concepts across several domains:

- post-quantum cryptography  
- experimental VM and execution models  
- distributed and mesh networking concepts  
- verifiable computation  
- navigation and inertial-drift modeling  
- simulation-aligned system design  

All projects are exploratory and evolve as research progresses.

## Public Repositories (Active Research Prototypes)

Below are the nine public repositories currently maintained by Baramay Station Research Inc.

### TetraKlein
Experimental R&D prototype exploring post-quantum cryptography, zero-knowledge concepts, recursive hashing, and containerized system modeling.  
Non-functional. Research only.

### TetraQC
Concept prototype examining abstract quantum programming ideas, symbolic computation pathways, and geometric encoding concepts.  
Non-functional and exploratory.

### TetraCrypt_Yggdrasil_Unified
Non-functional research prototype exploring post-quantum communication concepts, mesh-networking structures, and zk-STARK authentication models.  
Academic prototype only.

### TetraNav-PostQuantum
Open research prototype studying inertial navigation, drift-correction behavior, and environmental sensitivity in unconventional conditions.  
Simulation-focused. Non-functional.

### TetraYau
Exploratory prototype investigating geometric, algebraic, and Platonic-inspired structures in post-quantum cryptographic modeling.  
Research-only. Not operational cryptography.

### TetraYggdrasil_Nexus
Non-functional research prototype investigating distributed communication concepts, WASM-based mesh-network constructs, and experimental authentication ideas.  
Conceptual study only.

### TetraNexus
